# codebase Summary: SwipeHire

## Overview
SwipeHire is a mobile-first web application designed to help early-stage startup founders screen job applicants efficiently. It employs a Tinder-style swipe interface (Right for Interested, Left for Pass) and leverages AI to parse resumes, categorize candidates, and generate summaries.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand (with persistence)
- **AI/LLM**: 
    - The project documentation mentions Google Gemini AI.
    - However, the implementation in `src/lib/gemini.ts` actually uses **Cerebras API** (`gpt-oss-120b` model) for ultra-fast inference suitable for real-time applications.
- **Resume Parsing**: `pdf-parse`, `mammoth` (for DOCX).
- **UI Animations**: Framer Motion.

## Key Features
1.  **Job Management**: Create jobs with specific requirements (tech stack, experience level, startup preference).
2.  **Resume Parsing**: 
    - Batch processing capabilities.
    - AI-driven extraction of skills, experience, projects, and education.
    - Automatic "bucketing" of candidates into Top, Strong, Average, Weak, Poor categories based on job fit and recruiter feedback.
3.  **Swipe Interface**:
    - Interactive card view for candidates.
    - Actions: Interested, Pass, Star.
    - Undo functionality.
4.  **Ranking Algorithm**:
    - Candidates are ranked using a weighted probabilistic shuffle based on their AI-assigned bucket (e.g., 'top' bucket candidates are 16x more likely to be shown than 'poor' ones).
5.  **Integration**:
    - Basic webhook structure for ATS integration (Workday, etc.) mentioned in documentation.
    - `agent.txt` outlines a detailed prompt engineering strategy for extracting profiles, scoring, and generating emails, likely used to guide the AI implementation.

## Project Structure
- `src/app`: Next.js App Router pages and API routes.
- `src/components`: UI components (CandidateCard, ResumeUploader).
- `src/lib`: Core logic including `gemini.ts` (Cerebras client), `fileConverter.ts`.
- `src/store`: Global state management via `useStore.ts`.
- `src/types`: TypeScript definitions for Job, Candidate, etc.

## Notable Details
- The file `src/lib/gemini.ts` is named after Gemini but configures the Cerebras API (`api.cerebras.ai`). This suggests a pivot or optimization for speed/cost.
- The `useStore.ts` file implements a complex ranking logic `rankPendingCandidatesForCurrentJob` to ensure better candidates are seen first without being a purely deterministic list.
