Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the provided schema.
Do not include markdown, commentary, or extra text.
If a field is unknown, use null or "unknown" exactly as specified.


User

Extract a structured candidate profile from the resume text below.

JOB CONTEXT (for interpreting relevance):
- Job title: {JOB_TITLE}
- Required skills: {REQUIRED_SKILLS_CSV}

        "dates": "string or null",
        "bullets": ["string"],

  }
}

Rules:
- Keep bullets concise.

- If email is not present, return "unknown".

PROMPT 2 — Score + Create Swipe Card (JSON only)

System

You are an explainable hiring decision assistant.
Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema.
Never mention protected characteristics (race, gender, religion, etc.).
Base everything on job-relevant evidence from the extracted profile.


User

You will receive:
1) The job requirements
2) The extracted candidate profile JSON

Your job:
- Compute a fit score from 0 to 100.
- Produce a swipe-card output that is concise and mobile-friendly.
- Provide top reasons + top concern grounded in evidence.
- Add tags grouped into strong/partial/missing aligned to the job requirements.
- Recommend one of: "interview" | "save" | "archive"

JOB:
{
  "job_title": "{JOB_TITLE}",
  "required_skills": [{REQUIRED_SKILLS_JSON_ARRAY}],
  "nice_to_have": [{NICE_TO_HAVE_JSON_ARRAY}],
  "experience_level": "{EXPERIENCE_LEVEL}", 
  "location_policy": "{LOCATION_POLICY}",
  "sponsorship_policy": "{SPONSORSHIP_POLICY}"
}

CANDIDATE_PROFILE_JSON:
{CANDIDATE_PROFILE_JSON}

Return ONLY JSON with this exact schema:
{
  "card": {
    "name": "string",
    "role": "string",
    "headline": "max 8 words, punchy but professional",
    "subheadline": "max 10 words, includes 2 key skills",
    "score": 0,
    "tags": {
      "strong": ["1-4 items"],
      "partial": ["0-4 items"],
      "missing": ["0-4 items"]
    },
    "highlight": "one standout project/impact line, max 12 words",

      {"reason": "string", "resume_evidence": "short quote or paraphrase"}
    ],
    "concern_evidence": "short quote or paraphrase or 'none'"
  }
}

Scoring rules:
- Required skills coverage is the biggest weight.
- Strong impact metrics and shipped projects increase score.
- If sponsorship policy conflicts with candidate work_auth, set recommended_action="archive" and explain in top_concern.
- Confidence is 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence completeness.

Will this be enough to win Arize?

Claude prompts alone aren’t enough.
Arize wants you to prove you improved agent performance with Phoenix.

To satisfy Arize, you must also do:

Tracing: log each step (extract → score → email) as spans/traces

A/B experiments: Prompt A vs Prompt B on a small dataset

Metric: e.g., “valid JSON rate”, “required skill coverage accuracy”, “email includes 2 hooks + next steps”

If you do those 3, you’re good.

Any other info I need from you?

Not required for prompts. But if you want me to tailor them perfectly, paste:

Your job filters schema (what fields your UI collects)

One example resume text or sample candidate JSON

Your current Claude API call wrapper (file path + snippet)

Then I can:

align the JSON fields exactly to your code

make prompts more robust to edge cases

give you Prompt A / Prompt B variants for Phoenix experiments

If you paste your current API route that calls Claude/Gemini, I’ll convert it into the 3-step pipeline cleanly.
