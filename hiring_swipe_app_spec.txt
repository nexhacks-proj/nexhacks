AI CODING AGENT SPEC — STARTUP HIRING SWIPE APP (MVP)

GOAL
Build a mobile-first web app that helps early-stage startup founders screen job applicants quickly using structured filters and a swipe-based interface. The product reduces resume screening time without fully automating hiring decisions.

TARGET USER
Early-stage startup founders (3–20 employees) who are actively hiring.

CORE CONCEPT
Applicants are pre-filtered and summarized by AI into high-signal “cards.”
Founders swipe through candidates instead of reading full resumes.
The system assists decisions — it does not auto-reject or auto-hire.

FOUNDER FLOW (MVP)

1. JOB SETUP
Founder creates a job with the following filters:
- Role title
- Required tech stack (tag-based)
- Experience level (none / 1–3 years / 3+ years)
- Visa sponsorship allowed (yes/no)
- Startup experience preferred (yes/no)
- Portfolio required (yes/no)

2. CANDIDATE INGESTION
- Upload resumes (PDF or text) OR use mock candidate data
- Store raw resume text for each candidate

3. AI PREPROCESSING (CRITICAL)
For each candidate:
- Extract structured fields (skills, experience, projects)
- Generate:
  - 2–3 strongest signals
  - 1 standout project or experience
  - Short AI summary (1–2 sentences):
    Example: “Strong fit for X due to A and B; weaker on Y due to limited experience.”

IMPORTANT:
- AI does NOT decide pass/fail
- AI only summarizes, tags, and highlights signal

SWIPE INTERFACE (CORE UX)

Each candidate card displays:
- Name
- Target role
- 2–3 key strengths (bulleted)
- 1 standout project or experience
- AI-generated summary

User actions:
- Swipe right → “Interested”
  - Auto-trigger next step (interview email or placeholder action)
- Swipe left → “No”
  - Archive candidate or send polite rejection
- Star → Save candidate for later review

Additional functionality:
- Tap card to view full resume
- Undo last swipe

HIRING FUNNEL POSITIONING
This tool operates between:
- Initial resume collection
- Interview scheduling

It optimizes for instinct-driven “no vs maybe” decisions.

NON-GOALS (OUT OF SCOPE)
- No enterprise compliance features
- No bias auditing or explainability requirements
- No final hiring decisions
- No candidate-facing interface
- No large-company workflows

HACKATHON CONSTRAINTS
- Focus on startup use cases only
- Mock data is acceptable
- Optimize for speed, clarity, and UX
- Prefer a simple stack (e.g. Next.js frontend, basic backend, AI API integration)

PITCH FRAMING (INTERNAL)
Describe the product as:
“A mobile-first hiring interface that compresses hours of resume screening into minutes using structured filtering and swipe-based decision-making.”

“Tinder for hiring” is a UX reference only, not the core value proposition.
